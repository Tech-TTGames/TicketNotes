# Some basic things to note before contributing

- Create requests in good faith.
- Make sure your code is as *clean* as can be
- Explain your reasoning when making a PR
- If you don't know how to make a feature yourself, consider making an [issue](https://github.com/Tech-TTGames/Tickets-Plus/issues/new/choose) instead
- Treat others how you would like to be treated (**Hint**: It's with respect)
